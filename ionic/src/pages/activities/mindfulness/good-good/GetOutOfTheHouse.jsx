      <p>
        Go for a drive or a walk to a beach, lookout, or park, even when your pain or
        the weather is bad. Releasing pent-up emotions. If need be, practise your skill
        at going there in your imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not many people can resist natureâ€™s temptation to feel better and,
        if nothing else, you will be doing something constructive to distract yourself.
