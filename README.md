# Oscar

Oscar is a digital support system that explores empathetic ways that young adult sufferers can manage their experience of inflammatory bowel disease.

The mobile application was developed from scratch over two weekends for [HealthHack 2020](https://www.healthhack.com.au/). The final working code is available on the [dev branch](https://github.com/HealthHackAu2020/Oscar/tree/dev).

# Technology

The application was primarily developed using Ionic React and is available as an Android and IOS application. Redux is used for state management and Firebase is used for the backed and user authentication. A chatbot prototype was also developed on IBM Watson Assistant.
